# ChurnChain

Turn cancellations into conversations.

## What It Is

ChurnChain catches churning SaaS customers at the cancel button and converts them into warm leads through voice-based exit interviews.

## How It Works

1. User hits cancel on a SaaS product
2. They're offered $50 Jabrium credit for a 30-second voice exit interview
3. They click → land in Jabrium → record why they're leaving
4. SaaS company gets rich qualitative feedback
5. User stays connected with credit to spend

## Value Proposition

**For SaaS Companies:**
- Voice captures what checkbox surveys miss
- Soft landing keeps win-back possible
- Risk-free pilot: pay nothing unless churn drops

**For Churned Users:**
- $50 credit for 30 seconds
- Speak naturally, no forms
- Convert to points, double the value
